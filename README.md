# Project-Landing-Page
Description:
This is an attempt to make a landing page utilising the skills on html and css we ve obtained so far

Reflextion:
-always save html file after any adjustment, otherwise time will be lost
-setting too many arbirtary absolute values can cause relative ones to not work
-Styling and getting creative proved fun, more work on bettering aesthetics will
prove usefull in the future
